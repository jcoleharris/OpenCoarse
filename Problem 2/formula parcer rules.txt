Polynomials
 - Clusters of 0+ Groupings of 1+ Terms each

Term
 - Have 1-sign
 	- Optional for 1st Term in Group; default = '+'
 	- If given, the Term must include 1 coeffiencient and/or 1-variable
 - Have 1-coefficient of 0+ digits
 	- Optional; default = '1'
 - Have 1-vairiable of 1-digit
 	- Optional; not having it changes coefficient into a constant
 - Have 1-exponant consisting of a '^' followed by a numerial
 	- numerial must be positive
 - Order
 	Sign
 	Coeffiecient
 	Variable
 	Exponant

Grouping
 - Terms can be grouped by parens or '()'
 - Polynomials with no Parens are 1 Group
 - Rules:
 	- Come in pairs, one '(' & one ')'
 	- Groups can contain 0+ Groups
 	- ( can be preceeded by:
 		Sign
 		Coefficient
 		Operator */^+-
 		Paren ()
 	- ( can be followed by:
 		Sign
 		Coefficent
 		Variable
 		Paren ()
 	- ) can be preceeded by:
 		Constant (Coefficient)
 		Variable
 		Exponant
 		Paren ()
 	- ) can be followed by:
 		Sign
 		Variable
 		Operator */^+-
 		Paren ()

Flow:
 - Test each character:
 	( = start of group
 		Increment Group Level + 1
 	) = end of group
 		Decrement Group Level - 1
 	n = Coeffiecient, Constant, or Exponant
 		default = Constant
 		follow ^ = Exponant
 		preceed L = Coefficient
 	L = Variable
 	+ = Operator
 		default = Operator
 		preceed n = Sign
 	- = Operator
 		default = Operator
 		preceed n = Sign
 	* = Operator
 	/ = Operator
 	^ = Operator
 		default = Operator
